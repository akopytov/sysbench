SysBench
============

SysBench is a modular, cross-platform and multi-threaded benchmark tool
for evaluating OS parameters that are important for a system running a
database under intensive load.

The idea of this benchmark suite is to quickly get an impression about
system performance without setting up complex database benchmarks or
even without installing a database at all.

Features of SysBench
--------------------

Current features allow to test the following system parameters:

-   file I/O performance

-   scheduler performance

-   memory allocation and transfer speed

-   POSIX threads implementation performance

-   database server performance
